== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it free? =

Absolutely.

= Why use this plugin? =

This plugin automatically adds the Facebook like button so you don't have to manually do it for each post. There are also options to customize the look and feel.

= Why is there so much whitespace under the like button =

Facebook has this space to show faces of Facebook members who liked your post or page. If you disable show faces in the settings it will get rid of that space. The options on the plugin also allows you to do that now.
